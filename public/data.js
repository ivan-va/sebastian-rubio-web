The need was to reflect three main elements: the Swiss flag, an Edelweiss flower and the water source so I chose the Matterhorn mountain for its relevance and symmetrical shape.<br>The label was designed to be printed either over the bottle or in clear vinyl and to be embellished with silver and metallic finishes. I chose a main shape for the label so it sits in the lower part of the glass bottle as an emblem. The edelweiss flower was custom made also.",

The label will be printed on textured paper with two inks plus gold foil and lacquer. This particular custom mockup required heavy photo manipulation to make it look as realistic as possible.",

		{
			"question": "How do I get started?",
			"answer": "Book a free consultation to discuss your design needs. If the prices and packages sound like a good fit, I’ll draft up a proposal for your specific project. Once the offer is approved, you'll pay 50% upfront for the project using a simple and secure online payment method.",
		},
		{
			"question": "How does it works?",
			"answer": "In order to make everything go smoothly, my design process is sequential. We’ll do the work in stages – briefing, conceptualisation, sketch, revisions and final design so when one stage is approved, we don’t need to turn back. Revisions will be necessary, usually up to three in order to achieve your goal. You can book more revisions for a fee.",
		},
		{
			"question": "How long does it take?",
			"answer": "From our first talk to the final results, I can deliver your creative solution in as little as 15 working days. However, each project is unique. Time for completion depends on the complexity of your task, and the stakeholders that shall be involved in the decision-making process. In order to ensure a top quality design at a standard rate, I highly recommend you contact me at least a couple of weeks before the deadline. If you're in a rush I can do it too, but it will surely raise the fees.",
		},
		{
			"question": "How can I pay you?",
			"answer": "I accept secure payment methods such as PayPal or Payoneer, but also stablecoins such as USDT.",
		},
		{
			"question": "Who owns the copyright?",
			"answer": "Copyright of the final work is yours upon receipt of final payment. By default I reserve the right to claim the authorship of the artwork, meaning that once the designs are public I can list them in my social networks and portfolio.",
		},
		{
			"question": "Can you keep my design confidential?",
			"answer": "Sure! Keep in mind that my portfolio is my only marketing tool. Otherwise stated, I keep the right to display any design project in any media I consider appropriate in order to promote my work once the designs are made public, or as agreed. Also, that's free publicity for you, too. If you need a signed Non-Disclosure Agreement, please contact me to discuss your needs as it would increase the price of the service by 30%.",
		},
		{
